## Swifty Algorithms

Swift Algorithms is a repo designs to contain various programming questions that are answered in `Swift`. I made this repo because a lot of programming questions are answered in programming languages like C, C++, Java, or Python. As an iOS developer I really love `Swift` and I wanted to work on my programming skils during the Covid-19 quarantine so here we are.


## How to Navigate this repo

1. Each folder is it's own question and contains its own `readme` [like this](https://github.com/dtroupe18/SwiftyAlgorithms/tree/master/Count%20The%20Islands) which explains the question. 
2. Inside each playground folder there is a `Contents.swift` file with a solution that can be copy pasted into any playground.
3. I wrote each solution as a test class so it's easier to check solutions and measure performance.
