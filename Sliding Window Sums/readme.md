## Problem

Given an integer arrray  `input` and an integer window size `k`.

Calculate the sum of all the sliding windows of size `k` inside `input`.

## Example: 

input = `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`  size = `2`

output: `[3,5,7,9,11]`

### Explanation:

We have the following sliding windows

    [1,2] = 3
    [2, 3] = 5
    [3, 4] = 7
    [4, 5] = 9
    [5, 6] = 11
